# Safari_Pokedex

In a forest safari, a variety of sounds of different animals and birds can be heard all around, but it is difficult
to identify which animal is around, only based on the sound heard inside the vehicle. When, an animal is
nearby and makes a sound, this IoT application aims to identify the animal based on its sound using a
Raspberry Pi. It is trained with available data-set using Random Forest Classification machine learning
algorithm. Upon identification of animal, the module broadcasts its information in real time to the
smartphones connected to it through a local Wifi access point. The raspberry pi has a local server
containing this information and does not need internet connection.
