# Baby cry detection
Recognition of baby cry from audio signal

This project's aim is to automatically recognize a baby crying while sleeping and start a lullaby to calm him or her down.
This is done by implementing a machine learning algorithm on a Raspberry Pi.
The algorithm is previously trained on a computer due to reduced resources available on Raspberry Pi.
